<chapter><title>Introduction to Bochs</title>
<section><title>What is Bochs?</title>
<para>
Bochs is a program that simulates a complete Intel x86 computer.  It 
can be configured to act like a 286, 386, 486, Pentium, or Pentium Pro.
Bochs interprets every instruction from power-up to reboot, and has
device models for all of the standard PC peripherals: keyboard, mouse,
VGA card/monitor, disks, timer chips, network card, etc.  Because Bochs
simulates the whole PC environment, the the software running in the simulation
"believes" it is running on a real machine.  This approach allows Bochs
to run a wide variety of software with no modification, include most popular
x86 operating systems: Windows 95/98/NT, all Linux flavors, all BSD flavors,
and more.
</para>

<para>
Bochs is written in the C++ programming language, and is designed to run
on many different host platforms<footnote>
<para>
Since Bochs can run on one kind of machine and simulate another machine, we
have to be clear in our terminology to avoid confusion.  The host platform is
the machine that runs the Bochs software.  The guest platform is the operating
system and applications that Bochs is simulating.
</para>
</footnote>, including x86, PPC, Alpha, Sun, and MIPS.  No matter what the
host platform is, Bochs still simulates x86 software.  In other words, it
does not depend on the native instructions of the host machine at all.
This is both a strength and a weakness, and it's the major difference between
Bochs and many other x86 emulation software such as plex86, VMware, etc.
Because Bochs uses software simulation for every single x86 instruction, it
can simulate a Windows application on an Alpha or Sun workstation.  However,
the downside of Bochs's approach is simulation performance.  To model the
processor accurately, Bochs must run many instructions for every simulated x86
instruction, and this makes the simulated machine many times slower than
the physical machine.  Commercial PC emulators (VMware, Connectix, etc.) can
achieve much high emulation speed using a technique called 
virtualization<footnote>
<para>
Virtualization takes advantage of simulating x86 instructions on an
x86 machine, allowing large portions of the simulation to take place
at native hardware speed.  Whenever the simulated machine talks to the
hardware or enters certain privileged modes (such as in kernel code),
the simulator typically takes command and simulates that code in
software at much slower speed, just like Bochs does.
</para>
</footnote>, but they are neither portable to non-x86 platforms nor open
source.  <ulink url="http://www.plex86.org">Plex86</ulink>, Kevin Lawton's
current project, is working toward an open-source x86 simulator with
virtualization.
</para>

<para>
To do anything interesting in the simulated machine, Bochs needs to communicate
with the operating system on the host platform (the host OS).  When you press a
key in the Bochs display window, a key event goes into the device model for the
keyboard.  When the simulated machine needs to read from the simulated hard
disk, Bochs reads from a disk image file on the host machine.  When the
simulated machine sends a network packet to the local network, Bochs uses the
host platform's network card to send the packet out into the real world.  These
interactions between Bochs and the host operating system can be complicated,
and in some cases they are host platform specific.  Sending a network packet in
FreeBSD requires different code than sending the packet in Windows 95, for
example.  For this reason, certain features are supported on some host
platforms and not others.  On Linux, Bochs can simulate a network card that
communicates with the world, but on BeOS the simulated network card may not
work because the communication code between the device model and the BeOS
operating system has not been written.
</para>

<para>
<!-- really more like Background or Bochs History, but maybe it doesn't need its own section unless it gets to 3 paras or so  -->

Bochs was written by Kevin Lawton starting in 1994.  It began as a 
commercial product, which ...&NEEDHELP; <footnote>
<para>
We need a Bochs historian to help out here.  For background, it would be
interesting to know how much Bochs used to cost and what it was used for.  I
thought I saw an interview out there somewhere where Kevin says why he started
it and some more background information.
</para>
</footnote> Finally, in March 2000, Mandrakesoft bought Bochs and made it open
source under the GNU LGPL.

<!-- 
we should make it clear that Kevin is no longer working on bochs,
but I want to get some more background.  Did he get hired by Mandrakesoft
to do plex86 at the same time as Bochs was bought?  In his linux.com interview
Kevin said: "The only way I can move Bochs to open source is if someone
sponsors that happening. That would be ideal, and would enable me to focus more
on Bochs and FreeMWare, rather than be sidetracked with related consulting
jobs."

The last version of Bochs that he released was 3/25/2000, three days after the
Mandrake press release.
-->
In March 2001, Kevin helped a few developers to move all Bochs activities from bochs.com to a new site at bochs.sourceforge.net.  Since then the Bochs Project has settled into its new home, and around release times has even hit #1 most active project of the week at Source Forge.  </para> </section>  <!-- end of Introduction:What is Bochs? section --> <section><title>Who uses Bochs?</title> <para> It is hard to estimate how many people have tried Bochs or use it on a regular basis, but a few statistics give an indication.  The bochs-developers mailing list, which is the primary source of news on bugs and releases, has over 300 subscribers.  The latest version has been downloaded over 40,000 times from SourceForge, not counting mirrors or CVS users.
</para>

<para>
Bochs has many different uses, and different people use it for different 
things.  Many people use it to run applications in a second operating system 
without needing two different computers or dual-booting.  Running 
Windows software on a non-x86 workstation or on an x86 Linux box are common
uses.  Also, because every hardware instruction and every line of simulator
code is accessible, Bochs is used extensively for debugging new operating
systems and profiling.  If you were writing boot code for your home-brewed
x86 operating system and it didn't work right, booting it in Bochs could
give you great visibility into what is really going on.  The Bochs 
debugger lets you simulate quickly or slowly, pausing whenever you want
to look at the contents of memory or the CPU registers.  Or, if you 
wanted to study which parts of a program take the most time, you could use
Bochs to measure often pieces of the code were executed.
</para>

<para>
Bochs has been used as a teaching tool in Operating Systems classes, in which
students used it to learn how the PC hardware works.  As a final project the
students had to add a new peripheral device, so they had to learn all about I/O
ports, interrupts, and device drivers.  Also, it has been used as a 
reference model to test x86-compatible hardware.
</para>

<para>
There may be as many uses of Bochs as there are users.  Do you want to run 
your old DOS games?  Or learn to program under Linux, without leaving your
Windows desktop?  You decide.
</para>
</section>  <!-- end of Introduction:Who uses Bochs? section -->

<section><title>Will it work for me?</title>
<para>
Bochs is very useful for some applications, and not well suited to others.
This section tries to answer the question, "Will Bochs work for me?"
</para>

<para> &FIXME; </para>
<!--
I want this section to set reasonable expectations for people before they
try out Bochs.  They should not expect to find blazing speed and complain
to the list because Bochs perfoms so poorly compared to their VMWare demo.
For simulating x86 on x86, if they want blazing speed they should look
at a commercial simulator or plex86 (though it's still in development so
it's not fast yet).

Another factor is ease of setup.  With bochs you have to go editing config
files in a text editor (with a very picky syntax), which is not for 
everybody.

<para>
If you are running on a x86 hardware, you have a range of choices.
Check the installation section for your host platform to see what 
options Bochs supports on your platform<footnote>
<para>
&FIXME; Well, it will when it has been written.
</para>
</footnote>.  Bochs will run on Windows, Linux,
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, or BeOS.  If the most important factor is speed, you may
want to try a virtualization product instead of Bochs (VMware, plex86).
</para>

<para>
If you are using a non-x86 machine, then Bochs is one of the few choices for
running x86 software.  Bochs has been known to work on Solaris (Sparc), 
Linux (PowerPC/Alpha), MacOS (PowerPC), IRIX (MIPS), BeOS (PowerPC), Digital
UNIX (Alpha), and AIX (PowerPC).
</para>

<para>
You can also find more detailed testing information on the testing
status page on the &bochswebsite;.  The testing status page tells which
combinations of host platform and guest platform have been tried by other Bochs
users.

     <question><para>
     Tell me about peformance when running bochs?
     </para></question>
     <answer><para>
     Because Bochs emulates every x86 instruction and all the devices in a PC system, it does not reach high emulation speeds. Kevin reported approximately 1.5MIPS using bochs on a 400Mhz PII Linux machine. Users who have an x86 processor and want the highest emulation speeds may want to consider PC virtualization sotware uch as plex86 (free) or vmware (commercial).

     <question><para>
     Does bochs use a disk partition to install the OS?

     No. You use a disk image file, which is simply a large file, like any other file, on your platform's disk.

     <question><para>
     Why can't I use Bochs with my current Win95 installation?

     <answer><para>
     Think about this. If you had two different PC's, they would require different hardware drivers. So you may not be able to safely move a disk drive with Win95 on it, from one to the other. Bochs is no different. It emulates a certain set of hardware devices, and requires each OS be configured for those devices.

<section><title>Downloading Bochs</title>

<para>
You can download Bochs from our web site at &bochs-sf-net;.  First, you
need to choose what version to get: latest release or a development version.
If you trying to get things working for the first time, a release version is
recommended since it has been tested the most.  The development versions
(sometimes called snapshots) may have some newer bug fixes and new features,
but have not been tested as much as the releases.
See the <link linkend="linuxrpm">Linux RPM Section</link> for more information.
</para>

<para>
Second, you can choose to compile Bochs from source code or install a binary
(if one is available for your platform).  Binary packages will be quicker to
install, and most include a small demo of a guest operating system called DLX
Linux to get you started.  However, some features can only be enabled if you
compile Bochs yourself, for example the Bochs debugger.  For multiuser systems,
you will probably need system administrator privileges (root) to install a
binary package.  If you only have a user account you can compile Bochs in your
home directory.
</para>

<para>
For those familiar with CVS software, you can also obtain the sources for any
version using CVS.  See the <link linkend="get-src-cvs">CVS instructions</link> for details.
</para>
</section>  <!-- End of Installation:Downloading Bochs section -->

<section id="get-src-cvs"><title>Tracking the source code with CVS</title>
<para>
CVS, or Concurrent Version System, is a software development tool that helps
to keep track of the different revisions of each file.  It is used by many
open source (and commercial) projects to allow multiple developers to share
their changes to the source code.  The Bochs source code and documentation 
are available using CVS<footnote>
<para>
You can download CVS software and documentation from 
<ulink url="http://www.cvshome.org">www.cvshome.org</ulink>.
</para>
</footnote>.

<para>
When you have CVS installed, the first step is to do a login and checkout.  The
initial checkout command is long and ugly, but usually you only have to do it
once.  The example below shows the CVS checkout process in UNIX.  On the
Windows platform, you can use CVS within Cygwin<footnote>

If you use remote CVS for other projects, you might have set
the environment variable <varname>CVS_RSH</varname>.  For this
type of CVS checkout to work, the <varname>CVS_RSH</varname> variable
should either be empty or set to <constant>rsh</constant>.
</para>
</tip>

<para>
The CVS checkout process (above) gives you a directory called bochs that
contains the very latest source code.  I will refer to this directory
as &bochsdir;.  In each subdirectory directory there's also a
directory called "CVS" which tells the cvs software where the code was checked
out, what version you have, and where to go for future updates.
</para>

<section><title>Getting the Latest Version</title>
<para>
Most developers use CVS to always give them the latest source code.  The
minute that any developer checks in a change, they are available to you
with CVS.  You just have to type <command>cvs update</command> in the 
&bochsdir; directory, and CVS will retrieve any files that have been changed 
since you did a checkout.  If you update regularly, each update takes a short
time because it only downloads the files that changed.  
</para>
<para>
The <command>cvs update</command> command tells you if any new files have
been downloaded from the server, and it also tells you if you have modified
any of the CVS-controlled files.  As it checks through the source directories,
it will list files that have changed with a single letter before the name
that tells the status of that file.
<screen>
  ?   "unknown"  This file is in your local copy, but CVS does not know 
                 anything about it.  For example, when you compile Bochs,
                 any files created during the build process appear as ?.
  U   "update"   cvs downloaded a new version of this file because it changed
                 on the server
  P   same as U, as far as I can tell
  M   "modified" You have changed this file on your disk, so it no longer
                 matches the version on the server.  This is not a problem.
  C   "conflict" You have changed this file on your disk, but this change
                 conflicts with a change that was checked in.  Conflicts
                 occur when two people change the same line of code in
                 different ways.  You need to edit the conflicting file(s)
                 and clean it up by hand.  Or, sometimes it's easiest to 
                 discard your own edits and just download a fresh copy,
                 by deleting the conflicting file and running cvs update again.
</screen>
</para>

<para>
If you have been using cvs update with "sticky tags" to retrieve other
versions, described later, cvs will remember which version you were looking at.
In this case, a <command>cvs update</command> will keep your sources consistent
with that version.  If you want to get back to looking at the
latest code again, add the <command>-A</command> option.
This clears the sticky tags.

<title>Linux RPM</title>
<para>
RPM stands for "RedHat Package Manager."  An RPM is a compressed file
containing files to be installed on your system.  Many Linux distributions,
not just RedHat ones, can install files from an RPM.  Debian packages are
available as well, but this section talks deals with RPMs.  First, download the
Bochs RPM for your architecture to your computer.  If you have an
Intel-compatible computer, be sure to get the RPM that says "for Linux x86
distributions."  Once you have the package on your local disk, you should be
able to install it as follows<footnote>
<para>
Many distributions have their own RPM installer program, often graphical, and
they should work as well.  It is helpful to be able to see the text output from
RPM, so if you use a fancy RPM installer, be sure to find the text output and
check that it looks correct.

The Bochs RPM installs three new commands and associated manual pages: bochs,
bochs-dlx, and bximage.  First, let's try out the DLX Linux demo by typing
<command>bochs-dlx</command>.  This command is installed into 
<filename>/usr/local/bin</filename>, so you might need to add that
directory to your <varname>PATH</varname> variable.

Then you get a new X11 window containing the VGA display of the simulated
machine.  First you see the VGA BIOS screen, then Linux uncompresses and
boots, and you get a login prompt.  Type "root" and ENTER to log in to

  All releases are gzip'd tar files. That means the whole Bochs source code directory has been consolidated into one file using the Unix command 'tar', then compressed to save space with GNU 'gzip'. To extract the source code, you'll need both 'tar' and 'gzip/gunzip'. All files are contained within one subdirectory named 'bochs-YYMMDDv'.
