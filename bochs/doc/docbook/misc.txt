Testing testing....

This is a temporary place to paste in stuff that should go into the docs one
day.  When it is transferred into docbook, let's remove it from misc.txt.

Subject: usefull info for mounting 


I didn't see this in the doc's so I thought you might like a
short description of how to mount a disk image file into
loopback filesystem for maintenance purposes.

--------------------------------------------

1) First run

fdisk -l <image_name>

... and it should print out a partition table (with a few
complaints requesting the drive geometry, and I don't know
if older versions require a block device) In fact fdisk will
even work to modify partitions in an image, but you must
specify the drive geometry that's in the bocsrc first.

2) Whatever it says the starting partition is, subtract 1
and multiply by 512

3) Type

mount -o loop,offset=<insert number here> <image_name>
/mount/dir

or if it's just a floppy image, just

mount -o loop floppy.img /mount/dir

---------------------------------------------------

I would recommend putting -o ro for read only access if
bochs is in use.  For unusual filesystems you may need to
add a -t <fstype> flag to the mount command to specify the
filesystem type.

see man mount, losetup, and fdisk for more info



BOCHS Rocks!!!

This file has been in our main directory for years and years, and has not
been updated since nobody has tried to compile for MacOS pre-10 in a long
time.  I didn't want to leave it sitting there since it is so incredibly
obsolete.  I think it would be good to put it into the documentation
with proper warnings about the fact that it hasn't been updated in 4 years
and may need significant hacking to make it work again.
------------------

Changes by Bryce Denney 4/5/2001:
I moved the contents of macutils.h into osdep.h, and macutils.c 
into osdep.cc.  There are functions missing on other platforms too, 
so I wanted to bring them all into the same place.

The original macintosh.txt follows.

STATUS OF THE MAC PORT:

Status
------

This is an experimental Macintosh port of Bochs. The Mac port compiles fine
under CodeWarrior Pro R1 (CW12) and is capable of booting Win95 in command-
line mode and running DOS programs. A CodeWarrior project ("Bochs.proj") is
included (you may need to edit the type and creator information with ResEdit
in order for CodeWarrior to recognise it as a project file).

NOTE: MacBochs is very much a "work in progress", and much of the code is
incomplete. This preliminary version is being made available mainly to
interested developers who may want to contribute to the development of
MacBochs by contributing some code or testing it on their own Macs.

If anyone can test with some "clean" Windows installer disks, it would be
useful. I've been testing MacBochs with my SoftWindows HD image and disk
images derived from it, and I'm not sure if the various SoftWindows-specific
drivers are interfering.

23 Dec 98 - updated MacBochs to bochs-981222. The new version seems
noticeably faster. Finished implementing the Bochs headerbar. Added support
for ejecting floppy disks from within Bochs (click the Drive A: icon on the
headerbar or press Cmd-E).

17 Dec 98 - added real floppy disk support. Also optimized the graphics
screen drawing a bit more. Keyboard support still broken and in need of a
major overhaul. Does anyone have experience with KCHR resources and
KeyTranslate()?


How to Set up MacBochs
----------------------

This is a very brief, step-by-step guide on setting up MacBochs. More
detailed documentation will be available later.

- Step 1. Compile the version of Bochs you want to use (PPC, 68k or FAT) or
obtain a pre-compiled binary. There is a CodeWarrior project included with
the source distribution.

- Step 2. Create a hard disk image.
Bochs ALWAYS needs a hard disk image available to it, otherwise it won't
boot. To create a hard disk image on the Mac, you need to use a recent
version of DiskCopy.

First, create an untitled, empty folder anywhere on your Mac hard disk. Then,
launch DiskCopy and choose to create a folder image of that folder.

DO NOT ENTER THE DISK SIZE IN MEGABYTES. In the file "install.html" in the
"docs-html" folder you will find a table of disk sizes and geometries. Make a
note of the number of total SECTORS required for your desired hard disk size,
as well as the cylinders, heads and sectors per track (spt).

In DiskCopy, you need to choose "Custom..." from the menu of image sizes, and
choose to enter the size in "blocks" (on the Mac, a block is pretty much the
same as a sector). Then enter the number of total sectors you need.

Make sure the image is "Read/Write", not "Read Only", and make sure you have
entered the correct cyl=, heads= and spt= settings in your bochsrc file. Your
image file should now be accessible to Bochs.

You'll eventually need to use a utility like "fdisk" to make the image
readable.

- Step 3. Obtain a bootable PC floppy or floppy image.
You'll need to install an operating system in order to do anything useful
with Bochs. If you have installer floppies for a PC operating system (eg.
Windows or MS-DOS) you can use those. Otherwise you can download disk images
for FreeDOS or one of the many variants of Linux.

MacBochs now supports real PC floppy disks. To use the Mac floppy drive
instead of a disk image, use the special filename "[fd:]" in the appropriate
line of your bochsrc.

- Step 4. Set up your bochsrc file.
You set up your Bochs preferences by editing the "bochsrc" file. You'll need
to set up your bochsrc to work with your floppy and hard disk images, as well
as telling Bochs how many megs of PC RAM you want.

Problems
--------

There are some so far unresolved problems in the "macintosh.cc" GUI file:

- Keyboard support is VERY rudimentary; ie. it only supports alphanumerics
and a couple of special keys like Enter. The keyboard-related code is full of
holes and I'm going to completely rehash it.

- Mouse support hasn't been tested, but probably isn't fully working either.


Other Issues
------------

- The Mac port uses a ready-made config file (configmac.h), like the Win32
port used to. Macs are pretty homogeneous, so the settings should be
appropriate for most machines.

- The Mac port has an extra source file: "macutils.c" (with header file
"macutils.h"), which is used for Mac floppy drive support, among other
things.

- Like the Win32 port, the Mac port expects the "bochsrc" file to be in the
same directory as the Bochs application.

- Be sure to use Mac pathname conventions when editing the bochsrc file (ie
':' instead of '/' or '\').


New files
---------

The following are new, Mac-specific files:

gui/macintosh.cc
configmac.h
macutils.h
macutils.c
Bochs.proj


Changed Files
-------------

The following files from the main bochs distribution have been modified to
compile properly on the Mac:

bochs.h
main.cc
memory/memory.cc
memory/misc_mem.cc
iodev/floppy.cc
iodev/harddrv.cc

The changes are just conditional compilations which won't affect other
platforms (search for "#ifdef macintosh" and "#ifndef macintosh" if you want
to see what the changes are). These changes will need to be integrated into
the main distribution if the MacOS port is going to go ahead seriously.

The win32 build instructions are out of date too.  The --with-win32-vcpp
has been deprecated since at least March 2002.  More current instructions
are already in the docs, so this info may not be of much use.

Building Bochs for Win32
------------------------

This has only been tested with MS Visual C++ 6.0.

The normal build process on a unix system is to run configure to build all the
makefiles and config.h, and then run make to compile Bochs.  Configure takes a
large number of command line arguments, for example to disable floating point
or to enable sound blaster emulation.  Configure works beautifully on unix
systems to help make the code portable, however it cannot run on Windows.
(Maybe, if you have cygwin.)  Therefore, you need to either 1) run configure
on a unix box and copy the makefiles and config.h, or 2) download the
makefiles which are distributed in a separate ZIP file.

If you want to run configure yourself, consider using the shell script
".conf.win32-vcpp" since it has been tested.  Look at it to make sure
the options make sense for you.  You can always run configure by hand too,
just be sure to include the option --with-win32-vcpp so that it creates
makefiles for win32.  Copy config.h, Makefile, and the Makefiles in all
subdirectories over to your windows box into the same directory as the Bochs
source.

If you download the makefiles in a ZIP, just extract them into the
same directory as the Bochs source.  The config.h and top level Makefile
should end up in the same directory as Bochs.h.

Once the makefiles are installed, building Bochs is easy.  Start up an MSDOS
window, run the .BAT file that sets up the environment variables
(C:\vc98\bin\vcvars32.bat on my system), and then run NMAKE in the Bochs
source directory.  You will get lots of compile warnings, but hopefully no
fatal errors!  At the end, you should see Bochs.exe in the source directory.

Building a release on win32
Thu Dec  5 14:23:20  2002
Bryce Denney

In Cygwin:
  sh .conf.win32-vcpp         # runs configure 
  make win32_snap             # unzip workspace, make a win32 source ZIP

Copy the source ZIP to a windows machine, if necessary.

Open up Visual C++ and load the workspace file Bochs.dsw.  Check
the Build:Set Active Project Configuration is set the way you want it.
For releases I use "Win32 Release".

make install_win32 prefix=/tmp/bochs-2.0.pre3

OPTIONAL: Build bochsdbg.exe.
|  To create "bochsdbg.exe" with Bochs debugger support, manually change two
|  lines in config.h to turn on the debugger.
|	#define BX_DEBUGGER 1
|	#define BX_DISASM 1
|
|  VC++ will rebuild bochs with debugger and overwrite bochs.exe.  To avoid
|  trashing the non-debug version, move it out of the way while the debugger
|  version is being built.  Then rename the debugger version to bochsdbg.exe.
|	cd obj-release
|	mv bochs.exe bochs-normal.exe
|	<<build again with BX_DEBUGGER=1 this time>>
|	mv bochs.exe bochsdbg.exe
|	mv bochs-normal.exe bochs.exe
+---

Do make install_win32 into /tmp or someplace.

make install_win32 prefix=/tmp/bochs-2.0.pre3
This copies all the files into /tmp/bochs-2.0.pre3 and then creates a
binary ZIP at /tmp/bochs-2.0.pre3.zip.  Rename that 
bochs-2.0.pre3.win32-bin.zip

Now make the NSIS installer package.
cd build/win32/nsis

Unzip the binary ZIP file into bochs-$VERSION (must match Makefile) and 
then run make.

unzip ~/bochs-2.0.pre3.zip
make

That gives an installer called 'Bochs-2.0.pre3.exe'.
Test and upload.
