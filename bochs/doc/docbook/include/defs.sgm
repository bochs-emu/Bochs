Editing marks.  FIXME is just a reminder for somebody to come back and
work on the section.  NEEDHELP means that the author doesn't have enough
information to finish, and would like someone else to assist.
Presently, each one just shows an under construction icon.  We might
want some editing marks that don't show anything, or only show up in
draft mode.
