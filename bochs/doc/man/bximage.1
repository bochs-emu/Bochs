.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Bximage is an easy to use console based tool for creating,
converting and resizing disk images, particularly for  use
with Bochs. It also  supports committing  redolog files to
their  base images.  It is  completely  interactive  if no
command line  arguments are used.  It can be switched to a
non-interactive mode  if all required parameters are given
in the command line.

.SH OPTIONS
.LP
When you run bximage without one of the following options,
it will  appear  in  interactive  mode and  ask   for  all
required parameters to manipulate an image.
.TP
.BI \-func=...
Operation to perform (create, convert, resize, commit, info)
.TP
.BI \-fd=...
Create: floppy image with size code (e.g. 360k, 720k, 1.44M)
.TP
.BI \-hd=...
Create/resize: hard disk image with size in megabytes (M)
or gigabytes (G)
.TP
.BI \-imgmode=...
Create/convert: hard disk image mode - see the
.I bochsrc
sample for supported options.
.TP
.BI \-b
Convert/resize: create a backup of the source image. Commit:
create backups of base image and redolog file.
.TP
.BI \-q
Quiet  mode (don't prompt for user input). Without this
option bximage uses the  command  line parameters as
defaults for the interactive mode. If this option is
given and one of the required parameters is missing,
bximage will fall back to interactive mode.

This example creates a harddisk image in flat mode and sector size 512:

bximage -q -func=create -hd=100M hd100meg.img
.TP
.BI \--help
Print  a  summary  of  the command line options for
bximage and exit.
.LP
The
.I filename1
parameter specifies the name of the new image (create),
the source image (convert/resize) or the base image
(commit).
.LP
The
.I filename2
parameter specifies the name of the destination image
(convert/resize) or the redolog (journal) file (commit).
