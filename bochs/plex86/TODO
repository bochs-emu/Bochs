Fix monPrint and friends.

Could put the GDT/LDT in linear memory where the guest
  expect them.

Synchronize page writes with iCache in bochs.

Deal with cycle counts of guest execution in VM, and in
  bochs/plex86 shim.

Make a host-null.c file to demonstrate/test the OS-specific
  files that are needed for a host port.

Deal with page_usage.  How do we update this between timeslices?
  Do we always clear it?  Maybe we should keep a log of things to
  clear (page_usage, GDT entries, PDE entries, ...) and clear those
  before returning to user space.

monpanic breaks up into 2 monprints which hit user space twice.

Task segment must be a 32-bit'er.

Save/restore floating point state of host/VM.

pack guest_cpu_t structure.

deduct off some cycles for the IRET/int sequence.

Delete use of vm->addr, and split print-nexus into parts so we can
  use direct host or guest fields.  I don't like having implicit
  pointer usage.

Not compiled for debug
Compiled for BX_SMP_PROCESSORS == 1
cpuid match
x86 host

monitor uses slots 1,2,3 so guest ring3 should not
  use these slots.

FIX a20 in system fields.
FIX use of CPL in paging-mon.c.  We can eliminate any
  code other than CPL==3.


==================== From previous plex86 TODO file ====================

  This is a list of the major tasks/achievements/milestones yet to-do.
  We should keep this list prioritized, creating sort of a road map.
  Hopefully, this will reduce duplicate suggestions on the developers
  channels, and let people know where we are in the development process.
  Entries listed first have highest priority.

  <NEAR-TERM>
  - Fix plex86 on Linux 2.4.x/SMP or with 1P and LAPIC enabled.

  - Save FPU state on host <--> monitor context switch.

  - Special guest-specific drivers and special emulated pseudo-devices
    for faster graphics/network/disk access.

  - Allow some of the inactive guest pages be host swappable.
    Currently, all pages are locked down.

  - Many performance enhancements (see PERFORMANCE)

  - Test and get more guests running; list in 'GUESTS'.

  - Allow memory to be mapped anywhere in the physical address
    space.

  - Allow certain guest pages to be swap eligible by the host.
    This means they will have to be unavailable by the guest
    during that time.  Need a dynamic algorith for this.

  - Test on 2.4 with SMP/APIC enabled on single processor machine.

  - Deal with guest use of TF.

  - Deal with LDT


Use monitor unmapped IO port handler rather than user space.

Get rid of VM message count instrumentation spew to kernel log

unallocVmPages/unreserve_guest_pages called twice,
  release & teardown.

move mapMonitor to -host.c

Zero out GDT when remapped.

When is mapMonitor called?

Fix extra PDBR reload in nexus.S
