#=======================================================================
# LOG CONTROLS
#
# Bochs now has four severity levels for event logging.
#   panic: cannot proceed.  If you choose to continue after a panic, 
#          don't be surprised if you get strange behavior or crashes.
#   error: something went wrong, but it is probably safe to continue the
#          simulation.
#   info: interesting or useful messages.
#   debug: messages useful only when debugging the code.  This may
#          spit out thousands per second.
#
# For events of each level, you can choose to crash, report, or ignore.
# TODO: allow choice based on the facility: e.g. crash on panics from
#       everything except the cdrom, and only report those.
#
# If you are experiencing many panics, it can be helpful to change
# the panic action to report instead of fatal.  However, be aware
# that anything executed after a panic is uncharted territory and can 
# cause bochs to become unstable.  The panic is a "graceful exit," so
# if you disable it you may get a spectacular disaster instead.
#=======================================================================
panic: action=ask
error: action=report
info: action=report
debug: action=ignore

#=======================================================================
# com1:
# Specify the device to use as com1.  This can be a real serial line, or
# a pty.  To use a pty (under X/Unix), create two windows (xterms,
# usually).  One of them will run bochs, and the other will act as com1.
# Find out the tty the com1 window using the `tty' command, and use that
# as the `dev' parameter.  Then do `sleep 1000000' in the com1 window to
# keep the shell from messing with things, and run bochs in the other
# window.  Serial I/O to com1 (port 0x3f8) will all go to the other
# window.
#=======================================================================
#com1: dev=/dev/ttyp9


#=======================================================================
# PARPORT1:
# This defines a parallel (printer) port.  When turned on, the emulated
# printer port sends characters printed by the guest OS into an output file.
#
# Examples:
#   parport1: enable=1, file="parport.out"
#   parport1: enable=0
#=======================================================================
parport1: enable=0

#=======================================================================
# SB16:
# This defines the SB16 sound emulation. It can have several of the
# following properties.
# All properties are in the format sb16: property=value
# midi: The filename is where the midi data is sent. This can be a
#       device or just a file if you want to record the midi data.
# midimode:
#      0=no data
#      1=output to device (system dependent. midi denotes the device driver)
#      2=SMF file output, including headers
#      3=output the midi data stream to the file (no midi headers and no
#        delta times, just command and data bytes)
# wave: This is the device/file where wave output is stored
# wavemode:
#      0=no data
#      1=output to device (system dependent. wave denotes the device driver)
#      2=VOC file output, incl. headers
#      3=output the raw wave stream to the file
# log:  The file to write the sb16 emulator messages to.
# loglevel:
#      0=no log
#      1=only midi program and bank changes
#      2=severe errors
#      3=all errors
#      4=all errors plus all port accesses
#      5=all errors and port accesses plus a lot of extra info
# dmatimer:
#      microseconds per second for a DMA cycle.  Make it smaller to fix
#      non-continous sound.  750000 is usually a good value.  This needs a
#      reasonably correct setting for IPS.
#
# For an example look at the next line:
#=======================================================================

#sb16: midimode=1, midi=/dev/midi00, wavemode=1, wave=/dev/dsp, loglevel=2, log=sb16.log, dmatimer=600000

#=======================================================================
# VGA_UPDATE_INTERVAL:
# Video memory is scanned for updates and screen updated every so many
# virtual seconds.  The default is 300000, about 3Hz.  This is generally
# plenty.  Keep in mind that you must tweak the 'ips:' directive
# to be as close to the number of emulated instructions-per-second
# your workstation can do, for this to be accurate.
#
# Examples:
#   vga_update_interval: 250000
#=======================================================================
vga_update_interval: 300000

# using for Winstone '98 tests
#vga_update_interval:  100000

#=======================================================================
# KEYBOARD_SERIAL_DELAY:
# Approximate time in microseconds that it takes one character to
# be transfered from the keyboard to controller over the serial path.
# Examples:
#   keyboard_serial_delay: 200
#=======================================================================
keyboard_serial_delay: 250

#=======================================================================
# FLOPPY_COMMAND_DELAY:
# Time in microseconds to wait before completing some floppy commands
# such as read/write/seek/etc, which normally have a delay associated.
# I had this hardwired to 50,000 before.
#
# Examples:
#   floppy_command_delay: 50000
#=======================================================================
floppy_command_delay: 500

#=======================================================================
# IPS:
# Emulated Instructions Per Second.  This is the number of IPS that bochs
# is capable of running on your machine.  Read the note in config.h
# on how to find this.  Make sure to recompile after.
#
# IPS is used to calibrate many time-dependent events within the bochs 
# simulation.  For example, changing IPS affects the frequency of VGA
# updates, the duration of time before a key starts to autorepeat, and 
# the measurement of BogoMips and other benchmarks.
#
# Examples:
# Machine                                         Mips
# ________________________________________________________________
# 650Mhz Athlon K-7 with Linux 2.4.4/egcs-2.91.66 2 to 2.5 Mips
# 400Mhz Pentium II with Linux 2.0.36/egcs-1.0.3  1 to 1.8 Mips
# 166Mhz 64bit Sparc with Solaris 2.x             approx 0.75 Mips
# 200Mhz Pentium with Linux 2.x                   approx 0.5 Mips
#
#=======================================================================
ips: 1000000

#=======================================================================
# mouse: Not used in any of the GUI specific modules, but the option
#        bx_options.mouse_enabled is set to this value.  The idea,
#        is that the GUI code should not generate mouse events when
#        not enabled.  The hardware emualation itself is not disabled
#        by this.  This is to facilitate deterministic runs of bochs.
#
# Examples:
#   mouse: enabled=1
#   mouse: enabled=0
#
# I wouldn't recommend enabling the mouse by default, unless you have a
# really good reason to do so.
#=======================================================================
mouse: enabled=0

#=======================================================================
# private_colormap: Request that the GUI create and use it's own
#                   non-shared colormap.  This colormap will be used
#                   when in the bochs window.  If not enabled, a
#                   shared colormap scheme may be used.  Not implemented
#                   on all GUI's.
#
# Examples:
#   private_colormap: enabled=1
#   private_colormap: enabled=0
#=======================================================================

#=======================================================================
# fullscreen: ONLY IMPLEMENTED ON AMIGA
#             Request that Bochs occupy the entire screen instead of a 
#             window.

# Examples:
#   fullscreen: enabled=0
#   fullscreen: enabled=1
