<li><h2>
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bochs/bochs-1.2.1.tar.gz">Version 1.2.1</a> (June 12, 2001)
</h2>
<ul>
<li> more work on makefile for building RPMs
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=patch&id=432382">#432382</a>  ] build debian packages patch <BR>
  add build/debian directory from Rob Lemley <rjlemley@calypsoblue.org>
  which allows us to make Debian packages!
<li> optimize for speed when simulating one processor.  Now 1-processor
  performance should be equivalent to 1.1.2.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=patch&id=425640">#425640</a>  ] sb16 assumes fpos_t is long int <BR>
  This fixes compiles of iodev/sb16.cc on linux systems with newer libraries
  in which fpos_t is not an integer.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=432488">#432488</a>  ] SMP:assert "n_logfn &lt; MAX_LOGFNS" fails <BR>
  increase MAX_LOGFNS since we ran out of them on an SMP simulation with
  4 processors
<li> changes to compile clean on cygwin:
<ul>
  <li> don't use the WIN32 snprintf define for cygwin
  <li> add ssize_t definition for cygwin
  <li> only compile "struct timeval tval" if select is available
    on that platform.
</ul>
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=432491">#432491</a>  ] SMP: CPUID says no APIC feature <BR>
  clean up inconsistent use of BX_SUPPORT_APIC and BX_APIC_SUPPORT, which
  caused the CPUID to report no APIC was present
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=431025">#431025</a>  ] --enable-external-device-models broken <BR>
  removed configure options for external-device-models and 
  external-cpu-memory.  These don't work and aren't going to be fixed.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=429448">#429448</a>  ] configure: -lreadline when not there <BR>
  Now configure allows you to choose not to use readline, even if it's found
  on your system.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=428915">#428915</a>  ] apply extended keyboard patch <BR>
  extended keyboard patch by Dave Poirier <eks@void-core.2y.net>
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=428626">#428626</a>  ] if no X11 found, configure&make fails <BR>
  Now configure halts if X windows is selected but no X libraries are found.
<li> updated rombios to version 1.13.  This fixes several problems:
<ul>
  <li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=430472">#430472</a>  ] DOS HIMEM "A20 line" error <BR>
    This problem was apparantly caused when Bryce added a function that prints
    the BIOS version, and he called it too early in the boot process.  Now the
    same function is called later, and it doesn't break the A20.
  <li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=431010">#431010</a>  ] SMP structure overwritten in v1.2 <BR>
    SMP structures were getting overwritten by BCC-generated data, 
    preventing SMP operating systems from detecting that other processors
    were available.
  <li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=431016">#431016</a> ] bios: SMP struct has wrong entry count
    SMP structure had the wrong entry counts
</ul>
<li> very minor doc updates (typos, replace broken link to mtools info)
<li> quit when the user clicks the power button, even if they have disabled
  panics.
<li> win32 now defaults to having mouse capture mode turned off.  For new users,
  it would be distressing for their mouse cursor to disappear until they
  pressed F12.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=428222">#428222</a>  ] vga font not installed <BR>
  added script called "install-x11-fonts" which should help people install
  the VGA font on X windows systems, if it isn't already there.
</ul>

<br>
<li><h2>
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bochs/bochs-1.2.tar.gz">Version 1.2</a> (6/3/2001)
</h2>
This version is the first feature release from the Bochs project on Sourceforge.
The following list describes the changes since 1.2.pre1.

  <ul>
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=427259">#427259</a>  ] rombios HALT calls don't print <br>
  Fixed bios/rombios.c HALT macro so that it writes the line number of the
  panic to the PANIC_PORT (port 0x400) and then does NOT do a halt 
  instruction.  Also changed iodev/unmapped.cc so that the line number written
  to PANIC_PORT is displayed as a BX_PANIC message.  Because the HALT
  macro now triggers the normal panic behavior, it can be controlled by
  the bochsrc.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=429016">#429016</a>  ] crash if no hard drive <br>
  rombios used to call HALT macro if no hard drive was found. Now it only
  calls HALT if a hard drive has an illegal geometry.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=425388">#425388</a>  ] include source for simple disk img tool <br>
  [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=428478">#428478</a>  ] mkimg tool creates image 1 byte too big
  Added bximage tool, which makes empty floppy and hard disk images.
  It is now included in the top level Makefile, so it will get built
  by default on all platforms.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=426036">#426036</a>  ] eth_fbsd.cc compile problem on solaris26 <br>
  added configure test so that "configure --enable-ne2000" only
  includes the Berkeley Packet Filter code (eth_fbsd) if the header
  file <net/bpf.h> can be found.  If you don't have BPF the ne2000
  will not actually move packets, but at least it will compile clean now.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=428214">#428214</a>  ] 1.2.pre1 need documentation for binaries <br>
  Write windows and linux specific documentation to be installed in
  binary releases.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=429258">#429258</a>  ] disable RESET for version 1.2 <br>
  Since soft reset was not completely working, I reverted the reset patch.
  Now it does panics on reset instead of trying to reboot, as the old
  bochs versions did.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=428222">#428222</a>  ] Should the linux RPM install vga font? <br>
  now font/vga.pcf will be installed in the RPM package
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=429020">#429020</a>  ] stop renaming the BIOS!!! <br>
  new BIOS changes are now in BIOS-bochs-latest, instead of a BIOS 
  whose name changes every time we change anything!  To help distinguish
  different BIOS versions, the BIOS now prints its RCS Id into the
  log file.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=428625">#428625</a>  ] compile problem if SHOW_IPS is on <br>
  removed extra paren that broke SHOW_IPS
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=428219">#428219</a>  ] PCI doesn't compile with SMF=1
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=429375">#429375</a>  ] pthreads detection broken
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=429073">#429073</a>  ] configure: if no X11, makes bad config
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=429229">#429229</a>  ] install current .bochsrc in binary rels
<li> install Tim's man pages on linux RPM
<li> BIOS prints messages in log in case of boot failure
<li> rewrote instructions for compiling in win32 (win32.txt)
<li> fixed link in HTML changelog.html to point to the real sources on SF.
<li> added missing LOG_THIS definition to gui/nogui.cc and gui/rfb.cc
<li> added additional check for null pointer in debugger exit routine
<li> added diskd to .bochsrc
  </ul>

<br>
<li><h2>
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bochs/bochs-1.2.pre1.tar.gz">Version 1.2-pre1</a> (5/25/2001)
</h2>
  This version is the first feature release from the Bochs project on Sourceforge.  It is marked "pre1" because some of the new features have not had widespread testing yet.  When more features/platforms/OSes have been tested (and bugs fixed) we will make a real 1.2 release.
  <ul>
  <li> major cleanup of .bochsrc
  <li> major cleanup of stderr output: prints bochs version information when
    starting, and at the end it tries to print the message that caused
    bochs to quit.
  <li> two hard disk support (diskd).  At present, you cannot have two 
    hard drives and a cdrom at the same time, because there is only
    one IDE controller with two channels. 
  <li> split hard disk support allows different partitions to be stored in
    different image files
  <li> two new GUI choices: term mode and RFB mode.  Term is a text-only
    interface, and RFB creates a server that can be accessed using 
    the AT&T VNC viewer.
  <li> now Bochs can simulate an SMP machine, if you configure with
    --enable-processors=N.  Configuring more than one processor has
    a major performance impact, so the default is 1 processor.
    See <a href="smp-simulation.html">SMP documentation</a> for more details.
  <li> to make SMP work, bx_mem and bx_cpu have been replaced with
    bx_mem_array[] and bx_cpu_array[].  The cpus are referenced through
    the BX_CPU(n) macro and memories through the BX_MEM(n).  Normal
    mode has one cpu and one memory, SMP mode has multiple cpu's and
    one memory, cosimulation mode has multiple cpus and multiple memories.
  <li> use --enable-cpu-level=6 to make Bochs claim to be a Pentium Pro.
    The only feature that requires CPU level 6 is apic support.
  <li> new logging system by Todd Fries, which has 4 levels of event
    severity (panic, error, info, debug).  There are new .bochsrc
    options that control what action to take when a 
    panic/error/info/debug event occurs.
  <li> now searches for .bochsrc, bochsrc, bochsrc.txt, and (on unix only)
    $HOME/.bochsrc.
  <li> use GNU readline library if --enable-debugger is on, as long as readline
    can be found on the machine
  <li> configure checks for existence strtoull and strtouq. if neither exists,
    Bochs uses its own implementation
  <li> applied patches from Cliff Hones <cliff@aonix.co.uk> to fix up the
    rombios.  This includes many improvements, which you can list by
    doing "cvs log -r 1.6 bios/rombios.c" or looking at cvsweb.
  <li> added suggested geometries of larger disks to the documentation
  <li> this is the first release to have official binary packages for win32
    and Linux.  There is a new "make rpm" in the top-level Makefile which
    will create an RPM of the current bochs directory.  To use this,
    become root and type "configure; make rpm".
  <li> applied some FreeBSD patches from Maxim Sobolev (cdrom and serial).
  </ul>

<br>
<li><h2>
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bochs/bochs-1.1.2.tar.gz">Version 1.1.2 (bugfix3)</a> (5/16/2001)
</h2>
  <ul>
  <li> FPU is now compiled in by default.
  <li> updated Elpin VGA BIOS to version 2.40, and changed pointer in .bochsrc
  <li> fixed .conf.x86 script so that it uses c++ instead of egcs for C++ files
  <li> now Makefile targets that recurse into subdirectories use double colons,
    so that it will always recurse into subdirectories.  Now a single make
    command should notice a modified source file in a subdir.
  <li> fixed bug in bx_panic.  If BX_PANIC_IS_FATAL==0 and a (non-fatal) panic 
    occurs, it used to call bx_atexit() and then return.  It should never
    call bx_atexit, which starts to shut down the simulator, unless it's
    really going to quit!
  <li> support 2.88 MB floppy disks (Todd Fries)
  <li> since dataseghack is checked in as non-executable, invoke it with
    "csh dataseghack"
  <li> double fault patch from Thomas Petazzoni &lt; <a href="mailto:thomas.petazzoni@ifrance.com">thomas.petazzoni@ifrance.com</a> &gt;,
    sourceforge patch <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=patch&id=423726">#423726</a>.  
  <li> removed -fno-builtin from fpu makefiles
  <li> redefine u_char, u_short, etc. in order to not conflict with system
    definitions of these same types.
  <li> in cdrom.cc, remove the extern "C" { } structure around some of the
    header files.  This is no longer necessary.
  <li> do not panic on hard disk command 0x1f2 (read sector count)
  <li> in keyboard.cc:
     <ul>
       <li> apply Todd Fries' reset patch 
       <li> recognize most of the "Grey" insert/delete/home/end/etc. keys the
	same as keypad keys.
       <li> removed panic on "kbd_ctrl_to_kbd(): got value of 0x??"
       <li> implement mouse command 0xf6 (set defaults)
     </ul>
  <li> apply Suboner@aol.com's Xwindows timing patch, <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=418730">#418730</a>.
  <li> remove all patches from patches subdir which have already been applied.
    The remaining ones are under consideration but not applied.
  </ul>

<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bochs/bochs-bugfix-20010409-beta.tar.gz">Version 1.1.1 (bugfix2)</a> (4/9/2001)
</h2>
  <ul>
  <li> fixed type error in win32 soundwin.cc, added typecast to (LPWAVEFORMATEX)
  <li> now configure --with-win32-vcpp provides correct #defines for VC++
  </ul>

<br>

</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>This was the first SourceForge release by Bryce Denney, with patches from many sources on the bochs-developers list.
  <li>add BX_PANIC_IS_FATAL option.  <br>WARNING: Due to a implementation bug, nonfatal panics can create problems.  If you need to use BX_PANIC_IS_FATAL=0, move the bx_atexit() after the return line.  This problem was corrected in CVS after 5/2/2001, and appears in version 1.1.2 and later.
  <li>win32:
    <ul>
    <li>CDROM drive letter is no longer hardcoded
    <li>bypass fstat when opening WIN32 raw floppy disk
    </ul>

    <li> Integrated new FPU emulator mods from Bill Metzenthen.
    <li> Bill ported x86 specific assembly files to C.
    <li> I helped port the FPU emulator to work on big-endian machines.
         (tested on SPARC so far)
    <li> The FPU emulator is now integrated into the main bochs

  <li> Please wait until next release for running NT unless you really
       need it.
  <li> Created (incomplete) docs-html/guestNT.html to outline process

    <li> Recoded ::exception()
    <li> Recoded ::interrupt()
    <li> Recoded ::task_switch()
    </ul>
  <li> Cleaned up most warnings.
  <li> Added docs-html/codingguidelines.html.  Please peruse it, if
       you are a code submitter, and would like to comply with
       my code tyranny. :^)
  <li> Integrated new submitted Mac build files and gui code.
  <li> Have a few more issues to take care of before playing
       in the dynamic translation sandbox again.

  <ul>
  <li> CDROM emulation:
    <ul>
    <li> New ./configure option '--enable-cdrom'.  So far, there is
         only support for Linux.
    <li> I created a Linux specific CDROM component.  Mostly
         just ioctl()s needed to access a few functions of the
         cdrom.
    <li> Created 'iodev/cdrom.cc' and 'iodev/cdrom.h' which contain
         the low-level code.  Essentially, all the OS specific code
         is contained in these files.
    <li> Should be fairly easy to add code for other OSes.
    <li> Use .bochsrc directive 'cdromd: dev=/dev/cdrom, status=inserted'.
    <li> Will add an icon for cdrom to the UI later.
    <li> Tested cdrom emulation running Linux in bochs.  Use something
         like 'mount -r /dev/hdb /mnt/cdrom'.  Haven't checked out
         using it in Windows yet.

  <ul>
  <li> Moved default cpu level to Pentium.
  <li> Created docs-html/configure.html to explain options to configure.
  <li> Fixes to high-level CDROM support.
  <li> Added optional x86 hardware debug support:
    <ul>
    <li> '--enable-x86-debugger' is a new option to ./configure.
    <li> This is the debug support offered by an x86 CPU,
         not the native bochs debugger.
    <li> Added instruction and data breakpoint capabilities.
    <li> Added proper RF handling with or without hw debugging.
    <li> You can configure without this option for more speed.

  <li> FWAIT now calls FPU emulator like it should.
  <li> Changes to LMSW.
  <li> Moved a bunch of initial stderr messages to bochs.out.
  <li> More Pentium behaviour enhancements.
  <li> Modified HLT instruction.
  <li> GRUB now works in bochs and can load programs.
  <li> Compiled a new wm-FPU-emu version for this bochs version
       (only very minor mods).

       the bcc compiler.  Removed braces, and moved local variable
       to top level of function.
  <li> Fix to extended mem access BIOS function (int15h:87).
       This was killing Minix.
  <li> Fix to floppy.cc, was reading one extra sector.
  <li> Fix to Makefiles etc for compiling without floating point.
  <li> Minix boots again inside bochs.  Though, the keyboard code
       is not yet right for running Minix.  For some reason, if
       you comment out the 2 keyboard ACKs at lines 947 and
       966 in iodev/keyboard.cc, it works.

  <LI> (ftp://ftp.bochs.com/pub/DT/bochs-990312b.tar.gz)
  <LI> First teaser release with dynamic translation framework!
  <LI> Only a few instructions translated, but the framework
       is coming along nicely.  Read "readme.990312b" in the
       ftp directory above for more info.  I include some
       preliminary performance tests, and you can benchmark
       bochs with dynamic translation on your own machine.
  <LI> Many more optimizations are possible.
  <LI> Here's an excerpt from the readme file:

  <LI> Converted all read-modify-write instructions to use
       RMW versions of write_virtual_xyz() & read_virtual_xyz().
  <LI> Addition of Linux/PPC to successful port matrix.
  <LI> Dynamic translation framework is coming along nicely,
       but not included here yet.  I'll include it soon in
       an upcoming release.
  <LI> Roadrunner OS booted.
  <LI> Integrated many patches from bochs users:
    <UL>
    <LI> Floppy: change line support.
    <LI> Beos: BX_KEY_{LEFT,RIGHT}_ARROW, omitted _ARROW.
    <LI> Bochs port to Cygwin32 without cygnus layer (pure win32 mode).
    <LI> New version of win32.cc, fixes to fetchdecode.cc for win32.
    <LI> Fixes to keyboard.
    <LI> Fixes to X11 cursor problem.
    <LI> Added --enable-port-e9-hack for sending port output to console.
    <LI> New version of macintosh.cc.

    <LI> Each instruction gets it's parameters from a pointer to
         a structure passed to it.
    </UL>
  <LI> Added '--enable-time0' option to configure.  Use this only
         if you want to always start the cmos clock at the same
         value every time.  This is valuable for reproducable runs.
         It was invaluable to me during cosimulation of this version
         of bochs against an older one to find bugs.
  <LI> Fix in cpu/paging.cc.  Set all segment register descriptor
       caches to invalid, until they were properly loaded.

  <LI> Incorporated new serial port diffs.
  <LI> Configure senses if you have select().  New macro BX_HAVE_SELECT.

       block-special file.
  <LI> Minor fixes for Macintosh platform.
  <LI> Small changes to compile bochs on BeOS R4 for x86 using gcc.
  <LI> Fix to timer framework code in pc_system.cc.

  <LI> Added settable BX_SHADOW_RAM macro to config.h.in, in case
       your software counts on C0000..FFFFF being writable.
  <LI> Added 'cmosimage:' option to .bocshrc.  If you use this,
       an image file is read into CMOS registers upon startup.
       Then certain values are written over, as the IO devices
       initialize.  Not complete yet.  DON'T USE YET
  <LI> Added 'newharddrivesupport: enabled=' option to .bochsrc.
       Set this to 0 or 1.  If set to 1, some new hard drive commands
       are accepted and some behaviour is changed per some diffs I
       received.  After I have time to look at these more, I'll
       integrate them permanently and get rid of this option.
  <LI> Some fixes to keyboard/floppy/hard-drive support.
  <LI> Rehashed the CMOS code.  Now support the RTC, interval timer
       and alarm clock.  This code has not been tested properly.
