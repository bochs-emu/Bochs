<h2>
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bochs/bochs-1.3.tar.gz">Version 1.3</a> (December 10, 2001)
</h2>

<ul>
<li> networking works on Windows and Linux platforms
<li> emulated cdrom can now read from ISO image files, on any platform.
<li> new PIT model by Greg Alexander which is much more complete than the
  old one.  The new PIT is used by default, but you can switch back to 
  the old one if you configure with --disable-new-pit.
  (PIT = 8254 programmable interrupt timer)
<li> new configuration menus by Bryce Denney, which allow you to change any
  bochsrc option using text menus, then save the configuration into
  a new bochsrc file for later use.  You can disable the new code using
  configure --disable-control-panel.  Also you can use the command
  line arguments -nocp or -nocontrolpanel.  Also, there is a new
  "Config" button on the GUI that allows limited changes to the 
  configuration at runtime, such as changing the floppy disk.
<li> add docbook documentation directory in the sources under doc/docbook.
  The transition from HTML to docbook documentation is still in progress.
<li> Add new log action "ask", as shown in these example bochsrc lines:
    panic: action=ask
    error: action=ask
  When an event occurs which is set to "ask", you get a beep and message
  on the text terminal that asks what you want to do.  Choices are: continue,
  continue and disable future messages from this device, quit immediately,
  or segfault (where abort() function is available).  If compiled with
  --enable-debugger, you can also choose to enter the debugger.
<li> Parallel port emulation cleaned up by Volker Ruppert.  See .bochsrc for
  syntax of new parport1 line in bochsrc.
<li> PCI support improved by Volker Ruppert, including BIOS changes.  Still
  not complete.
<li> floppy controller returns a proper error response if you try to write
  a read-only disk image.  For systems such as DOS that actually use the BIOS
  services, it was also necessary to add code in int13_diskette_function to
  recognize a write-protected error and return the correct error status code
  (AH=3, Carry Set).
<li> the ROM BIOS now prints panic messages to the console.  Thanks to Cliff
  Hones for his console display code.
<li> the ROM BIOS detects nonbootable disks (Barry Allard), and prints a message
  on the console.  Barry Allard's patch who helped with checking the boot
  signature.
<li> LBA support added for hard disks.  (Not tested very much.)
<li>X Windows specific:
<ul>
<li> commit patch from David Haslam <dch@sirius.clara.co.uk>
  [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=patch&id=455763">#455763</a> ] Cursor trail with DOS Edit/Minix vi
<li> error for missing fonts now points to the documentation
<li> new option --enable-idle-hack, by Roland Mainz, which makes Bochs more
  friendly toward other processes when its CPU is idle.  Presently, 
  this option is specific to X windows.
</ul>

<li>Win32 specific:
<ul>
<li> now Windows 95/98/ME can read the physical cdrom (Don Becker)
<li> The default configuration for Win32 VC++, given in .conf.win32-vcpp,
  now enables the NE2000 and renames all .cc files to .cpp.  This keeps VC++
  happy but may make it hard to use CVS.
<li> The default configuration for Cygwin, given in .conf.win32-cygwin, now
  enables cdrom and SB16.
<li> See "new docs" on the web site for compile instructions for VC++ and Cygwin.
<li> The sources include a VC++ workspace, in addition to the old "nmake"
  makefile.
<li> ethernet support (emulated NE2000 card), coded by Don Becker.  This
  implementation requires a library called WinPCap, which you can 
  download from http://netgroup-serv.polito.it/winpcap.
<li> new utility called niclist.exe which lists the ID number of all your network
  cards (well probably you just have one).  The ID be used when setting up your
  .bochsrc.
<li> patch [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=patch&id=466403">#466403</a> ] make text colors more accurate.  The author did not leave
  his/her name.
<li> fix GUI bug [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=452159">#452159</a> ] win32: mouse stuck if bochs win partly off screen
  Now we center the mouse periodically, whether or not the mouse has
  wandered outside of the window or not.
<li> event handler recognizes the extended keycode flag
<li> fixes for raw floppy and floppy disk images (Don Becker)
</ul>

<li>Linux specific:
<ul>
<li> Ethernet (emulated NE2000 card) now works in Linux!  Contributed by
  splite@purdue.edu.  This has been tested using host OS kernel 2.2.14, and
  works with telnet, ftp, irc, lynx, etc.  Because it is a packet filter
  solution, you aren't able to talk to the host machine, only to other 
  machines on the network.  
<li> The default configuration for Linux, given in .conf.linux, now enables
  the NE2000 model.
<li> RPM build process configures with --prefix=/usr so that everything is
  installed in /usr/bochs instead of /usr/local/bochs.
<li> DLX Linux disk image is now installed so that only root can write it, to
  avoid security problems.  When you run the bochs-dlx script, it creates a
  local copy in your home directory and then runs it.
<li> code that determines the capacity of a cdrom now works for both ATAPI
  and SCSI drives (splite@purdue.edu)
<li> applied patch from bochs@sigint.cs.purdue.edu.  The comments are:
  > The Linux 2.4.5 CD-ROM driver sends a READ_DISC_INFO command which caused
  > an "unrecognized ATAPI command" panic.  Looks like READ_DISC_INFO is only
  > recognized by CD-R and CD-RW drives, so I ignore it for now.
</ul>

<li>Amiga MorphOS specific:
<ul>
<li> Bochs now compiles and works on Amiga MorphOS.  Configure with
  --with-amigaos.  For AmigaOS only, see .bochsrc for use of fullscreeen and
  screenmode options.  The Amiga MorphsOS is written and maintained by
  Nicholai Benalal <nicholai@chello.se>.
<li> raw cdrom supported if you configure with --enable-cdrom
</ul>

<li>BeOS specific:
<ul>
<li> Bochs compiles and works on BeOS.  Configure with --with-beos.
  Bernd Thorsten Korz <bernd.korz@insidebeos.de> maintains the BeOS port.
<li> raw cdrom supported if you configure with --enable-cdrom
</ul>

<li>MacOS X specific:
<ul>
<li> Bochs now compiles and works on MacOS X.  Configure with --with-carbon.
  Emmanuel Mailliard <e.rsz@libertysurf.fr> ported the Macintosh code to the
  Carbon API.
<li> The MacOS X application is built using (gasp) mkdir, copy, and rez.
  Surely this is not the right way, but it works.
<li> raw cdrom supported if you configure with --enable-cdrom
</ul>

<li>RFB mode:
<ul>
<li> apply patch.rfb-mouse by MURANAKA Masaki (monaka@users.sf.net)
  see this source forge bug [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=457968">#457968</a> ] Strange mouse motion on RFB
<li> add a retry loop in RFB code, so that if port 5900 is not available
  it can try 5901, etc.
</ul>

<li>Bochs Debugger:
<ul>
<li> do a vga update whenever you print a debugger prompt.
<li> added debugger command "info fpu" that prints the FPU registers.  If you
  do "info all" you get cpu and fpu registers.
<li> added debugger command "info ne2k" which prints all the registers
  of the NE2000 model
<li> add ability to do register tracing and flag tracing (Dave Poirier).
  Try the trace-reg-on and trace-reg-off commands.
<li> instruction trace now includes time ticks
<li> fixed problems in which bochs compiled with debugger measured time 
  differently from bochs compiled without debugger.  Also when instruction
  trace was enabled, breakpoints and control-C did not work.  Also,
  breakpoints at the beginning of an interrupt handler did not work.
</ul>

<li> add dependencies to makefiles
<li> logging code moved into a separate file, logio.cc
<li> new option --enable-slowdown-timer, by Greg Alexander, which kicks in if
  Bochs simulation time starts to run faster than real time.  This helps to
  keep the Bochs clock in sync with the real clock when the CPU is mostly
  idle.
<li> new option --enable-iodebug, by Dave Poirier, which creates an I/O
  interface to the debugger.  This lets you write software to be emulated
  in Bochs which can turn on instruction, register, or memory tracing
  using I/O accesses.
<li> improved detection of readline in configure script
<li> configure substitutes the version number into many files, instead of
  using sed in the makefile.  There are still a few uses of sed remaining.
<li> you can now use environment variables in bochsrc values.  For example,
  diskd: file="$BOCHS_IMG/diskd.img", cyl=615, heads=6, spt=17
<li> configure with --prefix=PATH works now
<li> running configure from a different directory works now, thanks to 
  a patch from Edouard G. Parmelan
<li> fix [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=433759">#433759</a> ] virtual address checks can overflow.
  > Bochs has been crashing in some cases when you try to access data which
  > overlaps the segment limit, when the segment limit is near the 32-bit
  > boundary.  The example that came up a few times is reading/writing 4 bytes
  > starting at 0xffffffff when the segment limit was 0xffffffff.  The
  > condition used to compare offset+length-1 with the limit, but
  > offset+length-1 was overflowing so the comparison went wrong.
<li> cmpxchg8b patch from Michael Hohmuth <hohmuth@innocent.com>
<li> apply patch from Thomas Fitzsimmons <fitzsim@cygnus.com> to fix compile
  problems when BX_SUPPORT_PAGING and BX_USE_TLB are turned off
<li> fix bug introduced in 1.2.1 which caused spurious exceptions.
  See patch <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=patch&id=439314">#439314</a>, Exception 1 (debug) on HALT, from
  thomas.petazzoni@meridon.com.
<li> add panic in ctrl_xfer32.cc where the IRET32 implementation is broken.
  This only happens if you are NOT in vm8086 mode or protected mode.
  The intent is to warn people when they are getting bad emulation, and
  encourage people to report how they got to that point.
<li> apply patch from Santiago Bazerque.  See this bug report:
  [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=463018">#463018</a> ] retf not removing parameters sometimes
<li> fix bug [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=461730">#461730</a> ] IRETD causes problems if NT-flag is set
  reported by Peter Lammich.
<li> apply patch [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=patch&id=455014">#455014</a> ] CR0 bug in 80486, described as:
  > In the register CR0, when the bit PM is enabled, the bit 4 is 0
  > when should be 1.
<li> apply patch from Mike Rieker <mrieker@o3one.org> associated with this bug
  report: [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=480422">#480422</a> ] gdt 'accessed' bit
<li> in task_switch when it tried to ensure that the old TSS was paged in,
  it actually used the new TSS address, fixed.
<li> updated the instrumentation code, and added a working example.  To try
  it, configure --enable-instrumentation=instrument/example1.  Then when
  you run bochs, you will get one line for each instruction PC and for
  each I/O access in a new file called bxevent.txt.
<li> set a bit in the CMOS that says the processor has an FPU.  This is
  from patch [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=patch&id=455006">#455006</a> ] Device byte is not initialized aptly.
  Author did not leave their name.
<li> add logging code to the "null ethernet" which does not require host OS
  support.  All this does is print the outgoing packets from the guest OS.
<li> cleanup of log functions (Todd Fries)
<li> add BX_ERROR for every command in ATAPI-6 that bochs does not support.
  I still need to do add some commands from older specs that are obsolete
  (and not listed) in ATAPI-6.  Commands that aren't in the spec will still
  panic.
<li> only put 0xf into the 2nd hard disk field when the cdrom is not present.
  This is a patch from Volker Ruppert <Volker.Ruppert@t-online.de>, who
  comments: "The fdisk command reports an unusable second harddisk if the cdrom
  is enabled. This patch helps, but I don't know if it is the right way."
<li> make hard disk code return error codes when data is not available instead
  of just panicing.  In particular, if the logical sector is out of bounds
  or the disk image cannot be read/written at the desired offset, we now
  abort the ATA command and return an error code.  Many of the old BX_PANIC
  messages are turned to BX_ERROR, so they will still appear in the
  log, but now the device model will try to communicate this fact to
  the OS instead of simply giving up.
<li> don't blindly reject odd length atapi commands.  There are cases when
  it's really ok according to ATA-4.
<li> for big endian machines, reversed the bit fields in interrupt_reason.
  This was pointed out by Nicholai Benalal.
<li> extended keyboard improvements by Dave Poirier
<li> major mouse patch from Dave Spring, that implements several missing 
  mouse modes.
<li> commit keyboard patch from David Haslam <dch@sirius.clara.co.uk>
  posted to mailing list, that addresses the problem of each key press
  printing ^@.  See cvs log for details.
<li> mouse performance fixes by Greg Alexander and Robb Main
<li> NE2000 fixes by Frode Vatvedt Fjeld, ecelca@yahoo.com, Greg Alexander,
  and angelos@openbsd.org.
<li> fix bug [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=468340">#468340</a> ] pic:slave: OCW3 not implemented.  Some event handling
  code appeared in the master pic but not the slave pic.
<li> fix compile problems in SB16 code, related to fpos_t being treated as 
  an integer.
<li> patch from Volker Ruppert <Volker.Ruppert@t-online.de> to fix
  midi output file so that winamp can play it.
<li> some cleanup of serial code by Todd Fries and Volker Ruppert, but it
  doesn't work yet.

</ul>

<h2>
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bochs/bochs-1.2.1.tar.gz">Version 1.2.1</a> (June 12, 2001)
</h2>

<ul>
<li> more work on makefile for building RPMs
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=patch&id=432382">#432382</a>  ] build debian packages patch <BR>
  add build/debian directory from Rob Lemley <rjlemley@calypsoblue.org>
  which allows us to make Debian packages!
<li> optimize for speed when simulating one processor.  Now 1-processor
  performance should be equivalent to 1.1.2.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=patch&id=425640">#425640</a>  ] sb16 assumes fpos_t is long int <BR>
  This fixes compiles of iodev/sb16.cc on linux systems with newer libraries
  in which fpos_t is not an integer.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=432488">#432488</a>  ] SMP:assert "n_logfn &lt; MAX_LOGFNS" fails <BR>
  increase MAX_LOGFNS since we ran out of them on an SMP simulation with
  4 processors
<li> changes to compile clean on cygwin:
<ul>
  <li> don't use the WIN32 snprintf define for cygwin
  <li> add ssize_t definition for cygwin
  <li> only compile "struct timeval tval" if select is available
    on that platform.
</ul>
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=432491">#432491</a>  ] SMP: CPUID says no APIC feature <BR>
  clean up inconsistent use of BX_SUPPORT_APIC and BX_APIC_SUPPORT, which
  caused the CPUID to report no APIC was present
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=431025">#431025</a>  ] --enable-external-device-models broken <BR>
  removed configure options for external-device-models and 
  external-cpu-memory.  These don't work and aren't going to be fixed.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=429448">#429448</a>  ] configure: -lreadline when not there <BR>
  Now configure allows you to choose not to use readline, even if it's found
  on your system.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=428915">#428915</a>  ] apply extended keyboard patch <BR>
  extended keyboard patch by Dave Poirier <eks@void-core.2y.net>
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=428626">#428626</a>  ] if no X11 found, configure&make fails <BR>
  Now configure halts if X windows is selected but no X libraries are found.
<li> updated rombios to version 1.13.  This fixes several problems:
<ul>
  <li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=430472">#430472</a>  ] DOS HIMEM "A20 line" error <BR>
    This problem was apparantly caused when Bryce added a function that prints
    the BIOS version, and he called it too early in the boot process.  Now the
    same function is called later, and it doesn't break the A20.
  <li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=431010">#431010</a>  ] SMP structure overwritten in v1.2 <BR>
    SMP structures were getting overwritten by BCC-generated data, 
    preventing SMP operating systems from detecting that other processors
    were available.
  <li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=431016">#431016</a> ] bios: SMP struct has wrong entry count
    SMP structure had the wrong entry counts
</ul>
<li> very minor doc updates (typos, replace broken link to mtools info)
<li> quit when the user clicks the power button, even if they have disabled
  panics.
<li> win32 now defaults to having mouse capture mode turned off.  For new users,
  it would be distressing for their mouse cursor to disappear until they
  pressed F12.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=428222">#428222</a>  ] vga font not installed <BR>
  added script called "install-x11-fonts" which should help people install
  the VGA font on X windows systems, if it isn't already there.
</ul>

<a name="v1.2">
<h2>
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bochs/bochs-1.2.tar.gz">Version 1.2</a> (June 3, 2001)
</h2>
This version is the first feature release from the Bochs project on Sourceforge.
The following list describes the changes since 1.2.pre1.

  <ul>
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=427259">#427259</a>  ] rombios HALT calls don't print <br>
  Fixed bios/rombios.c HALT macro so that it writes the line number of the
  panic to the PANIC_PORT (port 0x400) and then does NOT do a halt 
  instruction.  Also changed iodev/unmapped.cc so that the line number written
  to PANIC_PORT is displayed as a BX_PANIC message.  Because the HALT
  macro now triggers the normal panic behavior, it can be controlled by
  the bochsrc.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=429016">#429016</a>  ] crash if no hard drive <br>
  rombios used to call HALT macro if no hard drive was found. Now it only
  calls HALT if a hard drive has an illegal geometry.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=425388">#425388</a>  ] include source for simple disk img tool <br>
  [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=428478">#428478</a>  ] mkimg tool creates image 1 byte too big
  Added bximage tool, which makes empty floppy and hard disk images.
  It is now included in the top level Makefile, so it will get built
  by default on all platforms.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=426036">#426036</a>  ] eth_fbsd.cc compile problem on solaris26 <br>
  added configure test so that "configure --enable-ne2000" only
  includes the Berkeley Packet Filter code (eth_fbsd) if the header
  file <net/bpf.h> can be found.  If you don't have BPF the ne2000
  will not actually move packets, but at least it will compile clean now.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=428214">#428214</a>  ] 1.2.pre1 need documentation for binaries <br>
  Write windows and linux specific documentation to be installed in
  binary releases.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=429258">#429258</a>  ] disable RESET for version 1.2 <br>
  Since soft reset was not completely working, I reverted the reset patch.
  Now it does panics on reset instead of trying to reboot, as the old
  bochs versions did.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=428222">#428222</a>  ] Should the linux RPM install vga font? <br>
  now font/vga.pcf will be installed in the RPM package
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=429020">#429020</a>  ] stop renaming the BIOS!!! <br>
  new BIOS changes are now in BIOS-bochs-latest, instead of a BIOS 
  whose name changes every time we change anything!  To help distinguish
  different BIOS versions, the BIOS now prints its RCS Id into the
  log file.
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=428625">#428625</a>  ] compile problem if SHOW_IPS is on <br>
  removed extra paren that broke SHOW_IPS
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=428219">#428219</a>  ] PCI doesn't compile with SMF=1
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=429375">#429375</a>  ] pthreads detection broken
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=429073">#429073</a>  ] configure: if no X11, makes bad config
<li> [ <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=429229">#429229</a>  ] install current .bochsrc in binary rels
<li> install Tim's man pages on linux RPM
<li> BIOS prints messages in log in case of boot failure
<li> rewrote instructions for compiling in win32 (win32.txt)
<li> fixed link in HTML changelog.html to point to the real sources on SF.
<li> added missing LOG_THIS definition to gui/nogui.cc and gui/rfb.cc
<li> added additional check for null pointer in debugger exit routine
<li> added diskd to .bochsrc
  </ul>

<a name="v1.2.pre1">
<h2>
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bochs/bochs-1.2.pre1.tar.gz">Version 1.2-pre1</a> (May 25, 2001)
</h2>
  This version is the first feature release from the Bochs project on Sourceforge.  It is marked "pre1" because some of the new features have not had widespread testing yet.  When more features/platforms/OSes have been tested (and bugs fixed) we will make a real 1.2 release.
  <ul>
  <li> major cleanup of .bochsrc
  <li> major cleanup of stderr output: prints bochs version information when
    starting, and at the end it tries to print the message that caused
    bochs to quit.
  <li> two hard disk support (diskd).  At present, you cannot have two 
    hard drives and a cdrom at the same time, because there is only
    one IDE controller with two channels. 
  <li> split hard disk support allows different partitions to be stored in
    different image files
  <li> two new GUI choices: term mode and RFB mode.  Term is a text-only
    interface, and RFB creates a server that can be accessed using 
    the AT&T VNC viewer.
  <li> now Bochs can simulate an SMP machine, if you configure with
    --enable-processors=N.  Configuring more than one processor has
    a major performance impact, so the default is 1 processor.
    See <a href="smp-simulation.html">SMP documentation</a> for more details.
  <li> to make SMP work, bx_mem and bx_cpu have been replaced with
    bx_mem_array[] and bx_cpu_array[].  The cpus are referenced through
    the BX_CPU(n) macro and memories through the BX_MEM(n).  Normal
    mode has one cpu and one memory, SMP mode has multiple cpu's and
    one memory, cosimulation mode has multiple cpus and multiple memories.
  <li> use --enable-cpu-level=6 to make Bochs claim to be a Pentium Pro.
    The only feature that requires CPU level 6 is apic support.
  <li> new logging system by Todd Fries, which has 4 levels of event
    severity (panic, error, info, debug).  There are new .bochsrc
    options that control what action to take when a 
    panic/error/info/debug event occurs.
  <li> now searches for .bochsrc, bochsrc, bochsrc.txt, and (on unix only)
    $HOME/.bochsrc.
  <li> use GNU readline library if --enable-debugger is on, as long as readline
    can be found on the machine
  <li> configure checks for existence strtoull and strtouq. if neither exists,
    Bochs uses its own implementation
  <li> applied patches from Cliff Hones <cliff@aonix.co.uk> to fix up the
    rombios.  This includes many improvements, which you can list by
    doing "cvs log -r 1.6 bios/rombios.c" or looking at cvsweb.
  <li> added suggested geometries of larger disks to the documentation
  <li> this is the first release to have official binary packages for win32
    and Linux.  There is a new "make rpm" in the top-level Makefile which
    will create an RPM of the current bochs directory.  To use this,
    become root and type "configure; make rpm".
  <li> applied some FreeBSD patches from Maxim Sobolev (cdrom and serial).

</h2>
  <ul>
  <li> FPU is now compiled in by default.
  <li> updated Elpin VGA BIOS to version 2.40, and changed pointer in .bochsrc
  <li> fixed .conf.x86 script so that it uses c++ instead of egcs for C++ files
  <li> now Makefile targets that recurse into subdirectories use double colons,
    so that it will always recurse into subdirectories.  Now a single make
    command should notice a modified source file in a subdir.
  <li> fixed bug in bx_panic.  If BX_PANIC_IS_FATAL==0 and a (non-fatal) panic 
    occurs, it used to call bx_atexit() and then return.  It should never
    call bx_atexit, which starts to shut down the simulator, unless it's
    really going to quit!
  <li> support 2.88 MB floppy disks (Todd Fries)
  <li> since dataseghack is checked in as non-executable, invoke it with
    "csh dataseghack"
  <li> double fault patch from Thomas Petazzoni &lt; <a href="mailto:thomas.petazzoni@ifrance.com">thomas.petazzoni@ifrance.com</a> &gt;,
    sourceforge patch <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=patch&id=423726">#423726</a>.  
  <li> removed -fno-builtin from fpu makefiles
  <li> redefine u_char, u_short, etc. in order to not conflict with system
    definitions of these same types.
  <li> in cdrom.cc, remove the extern "C" { } structure around some of the
    header files.  This is no longer necessary.
  <li> do not panic on hard disk command 0x1f2 (read sector count)
  <li> in keyboard.cc:
     <ul>
       <li> apply Todd Fries' reset patch 
       <li> recognize most of the "Grey" insert/delete/home/end/etc. keys the
	same as keypad keys.
       <li> removed panic on "kbd_ctrl_to_kbd(): got value of 0x??"
       <li> implement mouse command 0xf6 (set defaults)
     </ul>
  <li> apply Suboner@aol.com's Xwindows timing patch, <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/topper.pl?sftype=bug&id=418730">#418730</a>.
  <li> remove all patches from patches subdir which have already been applied.

    <ul>
    <li> New ./configure option '--enable-cdrom'.  So far, there is
         only support for Linux.
    <li> I created a Linux specific CDROM component.  Mostly
         just ioctl()s needed to access a few functions of the
         cdrom.
    <li> Created 'iodev/cdrom.cc' and 'iodev/cdrom.h' which contain
         the low-level code.  Essentially, all the OS specific code
         is contained in these files.
    <li> Should be fairly easy to add code for other OSes.
    <li> Use .bochsrc directive 'cdromd: dev=/dev/cdrom, status=inserted'.
    <li> Will add an icon for cdrom to the UI later.
    <li> Tested cdrom emulation running Linux in bochs.  Use something

    <LI> A few more mods to integrate, DON'T USE YET
    <LI> Added '--enable-pci' to ./configure and BX_PCI_SUPPORT macro
    <LI> Added 'i440fxsupport: enabled=' option to .bochsrc
    </UL>
  <LI> Added settable BX_SHADOW_RAM macro to config.h.in, in case
       your software counts on C0000..FFFFF being writable.
  <LI> Added 'cmosimage:' option to .bocshrc.  If you use this,
       an image file is read into CMOS registers upon startup.
       Then certain values are written over, as the IO devices
       initialize.  Not complete yet.  DON'T USE YET
  <LI> Added 'newharddrivesupport: enabled=' option to .bochsrc.
       Set this to 0 or 1.  If set to 1, some new hard drive commands
       are accepted and some behaviour is changed per some diffs I
       received.  After I have time to look at these more, I'll
       integrate them permanently and get rid of this option.
  <LI> Some fixes to keyboard/floppy/hard-drive support.
  <LI> Rehashed the CMOS code.  Now support the RTC, interval timer
       and alarm clock.  This code has not been tested properly.
  <LI> Rehashed the bochs native timer support which some of
       the IO devices use.

  <LI>Rehashed paging.cc and TLB.  Fixed problem with dirty bit not
      being set after a read operation cached an entry in the TLB.
      Also, added in legwork for supporting 486+ syle paging behaviour
      for use with OS's which have copy-on-write strategies.

  <LI>added '--with-nogui' option to configure to run without any GUI.  Also provides
      documentation for the GUI specific functions.
  <LI>recoded the PS2 mouse BIOS and some mouse hardware emulation.  Mouse now
      works on X11.  Haven't implemented it for BeOS yet.  Double click timing
      doesn't work yet though.
  <LI>(possibly) fixed the panic during Win'95 install due to keyboard.
  <LI>added private_colormap option to .bochsrc.  requests a non-shared
      colormap from your GUI.  Only implemented on X11 so far.
  <LI>added mouse option to .bochsrc.  Not implemented yet for any of
      the GUI specific modules, but it will request that mouse events not
      be generated by the GUI.
  <LI>changed palette change technique to tell GUI of each individual
      palette element change.  The GUI has a chance now, to tell
      the VGA code if a redraw of the screen is necessary.  Redraw
      is not necessary if using a private colormap.

  <LI>moved config.h:BX_PROCESSOR_IPS to .bochsrc 'ips' directive.
      Now you can run the same binary on different speed machines
      of the same type.  Just tune the 'ips' directive.

      The BeOS module no longer uses any BeOS system fonts,
      but just includes the bitmaps in the source code.
