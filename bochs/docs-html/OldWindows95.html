Help on installing Windows '95 within Bochs
</CENTER>
</H1>
<PRE>
<B>NOTE: Please read message regarding licensing of software packages
    which you run within Bochs, and use of temporary files created to
    facilitate installation. <A HREF="3rdparty.license.html">3rd Party Software Licensing and Temporary Files</A></B>

What you will need before you start:

  * Bootable floppy image with at least:
    COMMAND.COM
    FDISK.EXE
    FORMAT.COM

    Note: To create this, format a floppy on a real DOS machine.  You need the
          system files, so do something like:

      C:\> format /u /s a:
      C:\> copy \dos\fdisk.exe a:
      C:\> copy \dos\format.com a:

    Then, copy the boot floppy to an file on a workstation that has a floppy
    disk drive.  <A HREF="install.html#Creating a floppy image file">Creating a floppy image file</A>.

  * Windows '95 distribution:

      * Windows '95 Upgrade CDROM distribution.
        This won't work as of yet, since the SETUP program is unable to
        read the floppy drive to confirm you have a previous version of Windows.
        You'll need MTOOLS for this.

      * Windows '95 for PC's without Windows CDROM distribution.
        This should work fine.  I only have the CDROM version above,
        so I can't complete the install, but I have the floppy version,
        and have enough info.
        You'll need MTOOLS for this.

      * Windows '95 Upgrade floppy distribution.
        This should work fine.
        Note: floppies 2 onward are in 1.68M format.

      * Windows '95 for PC's without Windows floppy distribution.
        This works fine.  I use this one.

  * Floppy image of the first floppy from previous Windows distribution,
    if you're Win '95 is an upgrade version.  This is for proof of
    license since you paid less for the upgrade.
    <A HREF="install.html#Creating a floppy image file">Creating a floppy image file</A>.

  * Compile Bochs and setup for the Win '95 environment.
    <A HREF="install.html#Compiling source code">Compiling source code</A>
    <A HREF="install.html#Setting up environment">Setting up environment before running</A>

  * Install the 'mtools' package on your workstation.  This will
    allow you to copy files from your mounted CDROM to your hard
    disk image file, which you will create.

Creating and Preparing a Disk Image File for Windows '95 Installation.
</H2>
Create a blank hard disk image file.  Bochs will use this file as
though it's your PC's hard drive, and all software is stored within it,
as it would be on a real hard drive.  For this example, I chose
to create a 112Meg image file.  The 'diskc:' directive in your
'.bochsrc' file should point to this file.  <A HREF="install.html#Creating a hard disk image file">Creating a hard disk image file</A>

  (.bochsrc) diskc: file=../112M, cyl=900, heads=15, spt=17

  unix-> dd if=/dev/zero of=112M bs=512 count=229500

Boot bochs with your 1.44Meg floppy image file.  Set the 'floppya:' directive
in your '.bocshrc' file to the path of the DOS boot floppy image you made.

  (.bochsrc) floppya: 1_44=../1.44

  unix-> bochs boot:a
  A:\> fdisk
    [answer defaults to all questions]
    [hit key to reboot, but Bochs will actually exit]

Boot bochs again, format the C: drive, and make directories to
hold the Win '95 distribution files and the contents of the
first floppy of your previous Windows version if doing an upgrade.

  unix-> bochs boot:a
  A:\> format /u /s c:
    >Proceed with Format (Y/N)?< [y]
  A:\> mkdir c:\win95
  [quit out of bochs by typiing Ctrl-C in the window you started bochs from]

Define an entry for your hard disk image file in your ~/.mtools file.
Make sure all other 'c:' defs are commented out.

  (.mtoolsrc) drive c: file="<path>/112M" partition=1

Test it out.  You should see a directory of C:, which will probably
have very little on it, and lots of free space:

  unix-> mdir c:

Installation from CD media
</H2>
Insert CDROM with Win'95 and mount it (the system automounter may do
this for you automatically).

<P>
Go to the 'win95' subdirectory within the CD mount point and use
mtools to copy the distribution files to your hard drive:

<PRE>
  unix-> cd &lt;CD-mount-point&gt;/win95
  unix-> mcopy * c:/win95
</PRE>

Now fire up bochs again, and start up the setup program:

<PRE>
  unix-> bochs boot:c

  C:\> cd win95
  C:\WIN95> setup /C /im /id /is /iq /in
</PRE>

Go to <A HREF="#Running Setup">Running Windows '95 Setup Program</A>.

Installation from floppy media
</H2>

Unfortunately, the first disk of the Windows '95 floppy distribution is
not the same format as the rest.  Disk #1 is the standard 1.44M format.
Disk #2 .. Disk #13 are 1.680M format, to save floppies.  Since you can't
change what kind of floppy you're reading from in mid-stream (at least
not yet) in bochs, you'll have to transfer Disk #1 to a 1.680 format
image file also.  Then you'll be ready to go.

<P>
You'll need to copy all 13 of the floppies to image files.  To do this
it's likely you will need a Linux system.  The problem is that you need
a sytem that you can tell what the geometry of the floppy that you want
to read is, when it's non-standard.  On a Linux system, you can use the
'setfdprm' command for this.  The configuration file for setfdprm is
'/etc/fdprm'.  On my system, there already existed the following entry:

<PRE>
  # Non-standard disk formats:
  #		size sec/t hds trk stre gap  rate spec1 fmt_gap
  1680/1440	3360	21   2  80    0 0x0C 0x00 0xCF     0x6C # ?????
</PRE>

Without doing anything special, you can copy an image of the first floppy.
<PRE>
  unix-> dd if=/dev/fd0 ibs=512 of=win95_d1
</PRE>
Now insert disk #2 in the drive.  Tell Linux you have a non-standard disk in
there now with:
<PRE>
  unix-> setfdprm -p /dev/fd0 1680/1440
</PRE>
Make an image file of all the rest of the disks (2..13) by using 'dd'.
<PRE>
  unix-> dd if=/dev/fd0 ibs=512 of=win95_d2
     ...
  unix-> dd if=/dev/fd0 ibs=512 of=win95_d13
</PRE>

You should now have 13 image files, win95_d1 .. win95_d13.  Before
running setup, you have to get the contents of the first one, onto
a 1.680 format image file, like the rest.  To do that:
<PRE>
  unix-> cp win95_d2 temp_1680

  # make entries in ~/.mtools
  (~/.mtools) drive a: file='path/win95_d1'
  (~/.mtools) drive b: file='path/temp_1680'

  # test out your mtools entries:
  unix-> mdir a:
  unix-> mdir b:

  # wipe out everything on b: to prepare to copy from a:
  unix-> minfo b:
  # a bunch of stats are displayed, along with the proper mformat command
  unix-> mformat -t 80 -h 2 -s 21 b:
  unix-> mdir b:

  # copy files from a: to b:
  unix-> mcopy a: b:
</PRE>

OK, now 'temp_1680' has the contents of disk #1, except its in the
same format as the rest of them.  You might as well over-write the
old one:
<PRE>
  unix-> cp temp_1680 win95_d1
</PRE>

At this point, you should have something like:
<PRE>
  unix-> ls -l win95*
  -rw-r--r--   1 user      grp      1720320 Fri 13 17:21 win95_d1
  -rw-r--r--   1 user      grp      1720320 Fri 13 17:21 win95_d2
  -rw-r--r--   1 user      grp      1720320 Fri 13 17:21 win95_d3
  -rw-r--r--   1 user      grp      1720320 Fri 13 17:21 win95_d4
  -rw-r--r--   1 user      grp      1720320 Fri 13 17:21 win95_d5
  -rw-r--r--   1 user      grp      1720320 Fri 13 17:21 win95_d6
  -rw-r--r--   1 user      grp      1720320 Fri 13 17:21 win95_d7
  -rw-r--r--   1 user      grp      1720320 Fri 13 17:21 win95_d8
  -rw-r--r--   1 user      grp      1720320 Fri 13 17:21 win95_d9
  -rw-r--r--   1 user      grp      1720320 Fri 13 17:21 win95_d10
  -rw-r--r--   1 user      grp      1720320 Fri 13 17:21 win95_d11
  -rw-r--r--   1 user      grp      1720320 Fri 13 17:21 win95_d12
  -rw-r--r--   1 user      grp      1720320 Fri 13 17:21 win95_d13
</PRE>

You probably don't want to overwrite any of those disk images now,
in case you have to re-run setup, so create one more working file,
and edit your '.bochsrc' file to point to it:
<PRE>
  unix-> cp win95_d1 floppya.1680
  (~/.bochsrc) floppya: 1_680=path/floppya.1680
</PRE>

Fire up bochs, and run the Windows '95 setup program:
<PRE>
  unix-> bochs boot:c

  C:\> a:
  A:\> setup /C /im /id /is /iq /in
</PRE>

Now, any time the Windows '95 setup program wants a new disk,
just go to a Unix window, and copy the corresponding disk image file to the
working floppy image file.  When it's done copying, type Return in the
Bochs window.
<PRE>
  unix-> cp win95_d[2..13] floppya.1680
</PRE>

  (Sorry, I'll fill this out after I re-install Win'95 and write it all
   down this time.  But for now...)

  Windows will take 30 to 60 minutes message
    [type Return]
  Windows '95 Setup Wizard (progress bar)
  License
    [type TAB, then Return to accept license]
  Choose Directory
    [type Return to accept default]
  Preparing Directory
  Setup Options
    [Down-Arrow 3 times to select Custom, then hit Return]
  .
  .
  .

  When setup asks if you want Windows to find the devices, select manual.
  In each catagory, unselect everything with the space-bar.  Then manually
  select only the hardware you need.  You can accomplish this with the
  space bar, Tab key, and Down-Arrow key.  From what I remember you need:

    standard AT/IDE drive
    standard floppy
    basic keyboard
    Default VGA Adapter card
    PS/2 Mouse
    no network adapter
    no sound adapter

  .
  .
  .

  I forget if at the end, Windows bombs out when it reboots.  If not, quit
  out of Bochs with a Ctrl-C.  Then restart it.  Windows completes the install
  then.
