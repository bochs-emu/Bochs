 Coming!</b></font><BR>

This page describes the latest progress as we move toward releasing Bochs 2.0.
Please check it periodically, because it will change regularly.
<p>

</b></font><BR>
Our last release was Bochs 1.4.1 on June 23 of this year.  Since then there
has been a LOT of development activity, especially since mid-August.  Here's
a summary.
<ul>
<li> CPU optimizations boost simulation speed by around 2x. (Kevin Lawton)
<li> Bochs now supports up to 8 hard drives, or 8 CDROMs, or any combination
(Christophe Bothamy)
<li> The wxWindows interface has grown so that you can edit all bochsrc 
parameters using menus and dialog boxes (Bryce Denney)
<li> Added support for the AMD x86-64 instruction set used in their Hammer processor (Peter Tattam)
<li> Added support for MMX instructions (Stanislav Shwartzman)
<li> Added support for SSE and SSE2 instructions (Stanislav Shwartzman)
<li> Remote GDB stub support (Johan Rydberg, Stu Grossman)
<li> Added plugin support for Linux, Solaris, MacOS X, and Cygwin.  Plugins
allow you to compile Bochs with support for many options and load the
pieces that you want at runtime.
</ul> 

Here is the current <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/bochs/bochs/CHANGES?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">Change Log</a>.  It is now complete, after lots of work by Bryce, Christophe, and Volker.
<p>

<BR><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#1e029a" size="4"><b>The Release
Process </b></font><BR>

Before the 2.0 release is finalized, a few things need to happen.  First, the
developers declare a feature freeze, during which only bug fixes will be
added to the CVS.  The feature freeze began around the first of November,
and will continue until the release is ready.  During the feature freeze, we
focus on testing Bochs in all sorts of configurations, fixing bugs, updating
documentation, and generally cleaning things up.  The freeze will last until we
have some confidence that the most critical bugs have been fixed or worked
around, and that Bochs will compile and work on all supported platforms.  <p>

During this time, the Source Forge bug/feature/patch trackers are very
important and very useful.  Any bug that we intend to fix before the 2.0
release should be marked with Group="to be fixed in v2.0".  At the time of
release, there will be no more open bugs, features, or patches marked for v2.0.
All items that are marked for v2.0 will be either fixed (and closed), or
postponed by changing their Group marking to something else like "long range
goal".  Using the bug database helps to ensure that nothing important gets
forgotten.  When you're looking at the Source Forge database, you can click on
the Group box and select just the items that are selected for v2.0.  <p>


As the release approaches, we make some pre-release versions with binaries so
that it's easy for people to try out the new features and check if we've broken
anything.  These will be called 2.0.pre1, 2.0.pre2, etc.  Meanwhile, we
continue fixing things, cleaning  up, and trying very hard not to add more bugs
in the process.  Eventually the developers will agree that we've done enough
testing and we should go ahead and call it 2.0.
